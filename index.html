        <h1>Welcome to Anthony&apos;s Website!</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I&apos;m Anthony! I moved to Canada when I was five years old,
          and have been in Sault Ste. Marie since then. In my spare time I
          enjoy<br />playing video games, taking care of my animals, as well as
          studying/cultivating mushrooms!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also listen to a lot of music, and have a small collection of vinyl
          records spanning many genres and generations. I also play a bit as
          well, the<br />guitar as well as the piano. I listen to all genres of
          music, but at the moment I&apos;ve been particularly enjoying Classic
          Rock as well as Indie Rock.
        </p>

              "No. And and by the way, you don&apos;t want to do that either. You think you do, but you don&apos;t. 
              You remember when you had to spam<br /> cities and say "need a tank", "need a tank", "need a tank" 
              during the Burning Crusade days? You don&apos;t remember that, because<br /> <strong>now</strong> you just push a button 
              that says "go to the dungeon". You don&apos;t want to do that. Remember that one bug that really 
              pissed<br /> you off that we fixed like 2 years ago? Still there in the past."<br>
